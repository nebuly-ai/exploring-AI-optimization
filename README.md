# Exploring AI optimization
This library aims to become a curated list of awesome material (cool papers, tutorials, courses, etc.) on optimization techniques to make artificial intelligence faster and more efficient üöÄ 

- [x] [Weekly insights from the best papers on AI](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/learning-AI-optimization/blob/main/weekly-insights.md)
- [x] **Quantization** [[Overview](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/learning-AI-optimization/blob/main/quantization-overview.md), [Resources](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/learning-AI-optimization/blob/main/quantization-resources.md)]
- [x] **Pruning** [[Overview](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/learning-AI-optimization/blob/main/pruning-overview.md), [Resources](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/exploring-AI-optimization/blob/main/pruning-resources.md)]
- [ ] **Distillation** [Overview, Resources]
- [ ] **Deep learning compilers** [Overview, Resources]

And many others. Do you have any idea on material to expand the list? We are welcoming contributions! And don't forget to leave a star if you found this library insightful ‚≠ê


# Contribute

We welcome support from the open-source community in any form ü•∞

We have recently published this library. We will continue to update and upgrade it with great material on how to accelerate artificial intelligence models and make them ever more efficient. We also hope you will also learn with us and help us keep the library populated with the best quality content.
