# Learning AI optimization
This library aims to become a curated list of awesome material (cool papers, tutorials, courses, etc.) on optimization techniques to make artificial intelligence faster and more efficient 🚀 

Among the best acceleration techniques for deep learning are:
- [ ] Deep learning compilers
- [x] [Quantization](#quantization)
- [x] [Pruning](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/learning-AI-optimization#:~:text=22%20days%20ago-,Pruning.md,-Update%20Pruning.md)
- [ ] Sparsity
- [ ] Distillation
- [ ] Cached datasets

And many others. Do you have any idea on material to expand the list? We are welcoming contributions! And don't forget to leave a star if you found this library insightful ⭐


# Contribute

We welcome support from the open-source community in any form 🥰

We have recently published this library. We will continue to update and upgrade it with great material on how to accelerate artificial intelligence models and make them ever more efficient. We also hope you will also learn with us and help us keep the library populated with the best quality content.

Open an [issue](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/learning-AI-optimization/issues) or drop a message in the <a href="https://discord.gg/jyjtZTPyHS">community</a> channel to
- Add topics you would like to be covered
- Ask any questions
- Report a typo
- Propose to include your research work


Fork the library, make the changes, and send us a [pull request](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/learning-AI-optimization/pulls) in case you want to
- Write new content on AI optimization
- Correct or improve some sections


Currently, the main contributor to the library is [Pier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierpaolo-sorbellini-64603012b/), and the library would not have been possible without [Diego](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-fiori-b64b3016a/)'s interesting insights and topic suggestions and support from the <a href="https://discord.gg/jyjtZTPyHS">community</a>.
